(2) Workshop:                GIS for the Masses - Enabling Geospatial Enterprise


Hands-On Computer Lab - $65 – Monday Afternoon


Does your organization or municipality have people who need to use GIS in their daily work, but barely know what a GIS is, much less how to use it well?  Intergraph’s new GeoMedia Smart Client provides an answer to a problem that is almost as old as GIS itself, "How can you provide simple-to-use geospatial business workflows to non-GIS experts that are both cost-effective and manageable?” This new product provides geospatial desktop capabilities in a server-based web environment to reduce the cost of ownership for geospatial enabled workflows. The “smart client” is a Java-based client connected to a geospatial server providing data access and processing. The client software uses a single-click installation, so there are no administrative costs per client. GeoMedia Smart Client uses workflow configuration and rules definition tools to implement highly focused and efficient workflows without the need to develop and maintain extensive and expensive custom code. This workshop will provide detailed demonstrations of GeoMedia Smart Client, its administration, and workflow configuration.

(7) Workshop:                The integration of visualization strategies in innovative and                                         effective GIS map design


 Lecture – Free – Monday Afternoon


New design strategies are re-emerging from early 20th Century psychological theory, and can assist us in creating maps that are more effective in communicating complex spatial relationships.  When GIS-generated maps leave the hands of the GISP or GIS technician, they are often scrutinized as communicative tools in addition to representations of data analysis. The gap between data management and communication is often broad, and can create misleading and fraudulent maps. So, it is through the use of spatial visualization strategies, aspects of visual hierarchy, and an understanding of spatial perception, that more effective GIS-produced maps can become effective and valuable communication tools. Practical advice and visual examples of spatial visualization techniques, cartographic element dominance, and end-user percipience are used to guide us from theoretical cartography to practical GIS.  Nowadays, there is no reason that the future of GIS should include confusing, misleading, and fraudulent maps.

(17) Workshop:                Getting a Grasp on the Nebulous GIS “Cloud”


Lecture - $50 – Tuesday Morning


What is the cloud?  How can I get my data there?  What is the future of the web APIs in light of ArcGIS Online and ESRI’s push to the cloud?  How do I choose an API?  Is HTML5 really as awesome as everyone says it is?  Are there any alternatives to ESRI in the cloud?  This workshop is for all of those who have asked, not known to ask, or think they have definitively answered any of these questions.  Join us as we attempt to harness and bring order to the GIS Cloud.

(18) Workshop:                Mobile Maps – All the Cool Kids are Doing It!


Lecture - $50 – Tuesday Morning
At one point in time we all have either heard, used, or thought these words.  In the “techy” environment of GIS it’s almost a necessity to be one of the cool kids “playing with the latest toy”.  If you are not, you may find yourself outside the “sandbox”.  Mobile data devices are redefining the “sandbox”.  Almost everyone is carrying around a mobile device of some sort.  Being able to utilize these devices as methods to collect and decimate information is becoming easier every day.  In this workshop we will look at some of the methods in which we can easily use these devices in the GIS arena.  So bring your Phone, Pad, or Tablet and we will spend a little time in the “GIS Sandbox”.  Besides, according to my children, it is the perfect reason to do anything.

(19) Workshop:                A GIS workflow for Physical Addressing and 
                                E9-1-1 Data Maintenance


Hands-On Computer Lab - Free – Tuesday – Full Day


The ACF (Arkansas Centerline File) program was started in 2002 and completed in 2010. The data supports street level geo-coding based on local road geometry. This is an adequate means of locating addresses for general purposes but not for saving lives or streamlining business processes. To remedy these and many other problems related to where people, places, and things really are, the AGIO (Arkansas Geographic Information Office) began working with addressing authorities to produce a statewide physical address point feature layer, beginning in 2009.


To support this effort, AGIO provides training to local government agencies in the development and maintenance of these data. Class materials and discussion provides an overview of address uses and users, explains why address point features are becoming the most important framework layer, and provides hands-on exercises in road, address, and ESN boundary editing, using ArcGIS V10.1


The workshop will benefit all individuals and organizations who work with physical address information or wish to learn about how GIS is used to improve local government services, especially related to E9-1-1.

(20) Workshop:                Storm Spotter Training 2013


Lecture - Free – Tuesday Night (2 Hours)


Throughout eastern Oklahoma and northwestern Arkansas, trained and dedicated individuals monitor the skies around their communities during severe weather events. These storm spotters provide first-hand severe weather reports to their local officials and to the National Weather Service, which are used to make critical warning decisions.


Being a storm spotter not only means dedication but also training. Each winter and spring the Tulsa office of the National Weather Service trains members of police & fire departments, emergency management officials and amateur radio operators on spotting techniques. Typically, the training is coordinated by a local group (such as an emergency management agency) and a NWS meteorologist serves as the guest instructor. The goal of the training is not just to recognize tornadoes but to have some understanding of storm structure, which in turn better prepares the spotter for the extreme and unusual circumstances. Other topics covered include an update on the latest NWS technology and procedures, ideas for organizing / coordinating spotter groups, and important safety considerations.


The training is free and requires no preregistration.
